# Possible Next Steps

- adjust color of the select box to fit in to the color scheme of the page.
- on desktop view, the columns shift when clicked on details.
- make pagination stable at the bottom of the page
- make routes per page changeable. dropdown selection for 10/15/20/30 per page which could be added on the EntryNumber component.
- make the design closer to the figma design with fonts and colors.
- bug to fix: sometimes when changing pages api call gets triggered and relaods the data.
